# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
- Create a Summary DataFrame on the types of cities (Urban, Suburban, and Rural)
- Create a line chart with the total fare amount per city type
- Analyze findings

### Purpose
-Practice how to create and merge DataFrames from given data sets
-Practice how to use Matplotlib to create graphs from sorted data
 
### Analysis of Outcomes 
Through our ride data analysis, we found a positive correlation between how close a city is to an urban area and the amount of rides used to get around. Furthermore, we notice a trend between population and price; as seen in more city-like environements such as San Fransisco or New York, a higher population leads to an increase in supply and demand for drivers. The increase in demand for drivers could be inferred from three things: a workplace recession, highly populated streets decentivizing people from owning their own car due to parking or traffic, and also the simple fact that prices are cheaper as a result from an increased supply of drivers. The growth in supply an demand for drivers can be further evidenced by the total amount of rides given as you go from a rural to an urban neighborhood.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
##### Deliverable 1:
-As of now, I'm not sure if had an issue with the groupby function, my data, or if I simply used the function wrong when grouping the total driver count. Also, my dataframe could've been cleaned up a lot more although I'm not sure whether adding bins would fix my problem and further structure my dataframe. Because I had strings in my data, formatting to two decimal places became more challenging then expected. 
#### Deliverable 2:
-For deliverable 2 I had a problem with the 'pivot' function.

## Results
-Fares are cheaper in city-like enviroments rather than rural environments.
